#  PTP Webcam â€“ DSLR Live View Video Plugin

Large sensor digital still cameras can provide an exceptionally good image for video conferencing, compared to most built-in web cameras.

This is a plugin to make compatible digital cameras available as webcams in video calls, for example in Zoom or Skype on macOS. It also allows control of camera settings from the computer to adjust exposure parameters and focus.

The project consists of a CoreMediaIO DAL plugin, and a preview app to test functionality.

**Note:** only video is currently captured, no audio.

## Installation

### System Requirements

A compatible camera connected via USB to a Mac running macOS / OS X 10.12 through 10.15. 

### Binary Packages

Download and install the latest release from the [PTP Webcam Homepage](https://ptpwebcam.org).

Installer packages for older releases are available from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dognotdog/ptpwebcam/releases) of this project. 

### Building from Source

If you want to build from source, you need Xcode. You can build the project and the plugin should be automatically copied into `/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL` to be available to the system. However, apps with _Library Validation_ enabled will need to have codesigning disabled to be able to access the plugin, see the **Known Issues** section below.

### Testing the Installation

Opening _Quicktime Player_ and creating a _New Movie Recording_ via `File -> New Movie Recording`, then selecting the camera source can be used to verify functionality. The camera needs to be plugged in and turned on, and it might take a few seconds to show up.

_Quicktime Player_ works because it has _Library Validation_ disabled out-of-the-box, unlike eg. _Photo Booth_, which has the capability to use different video sources, but is prevented from doing so because _Library Validation_ is enabled.

#### What it should look like

If the camera is connected, a status bar item with the camera's model number should appear and can be used to change settings.

### Uninstalling

Delete `/Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/PTPWebcamDALPlugin.plugin` to uninstall the plugin.

## Supported Cameras over USB

### Tested

- Nikon D3500
- Nikon D5500, Nikon D5600
- Nikon D7100, Nikon D7500
- Nikon D750
- Nikon Z6, Nikon Z7, Nikon Z50

#### Nikon D800 

- needs to be in Photography LiveView mode for exposure preview to be available
- LiveView timeout can be set to infinity via  `CUSTOM SETTINGS MENU -> c Timers/AE Lock -> c4 Monitor off delay -> Live view` 

#### Nikon D3400
- exposure preview not available
 
 #### Nikon D5100, Nikon D5200
 - potentially frequent (every few minutes) shutter cycling because of LiveView restarts
  

### Untested
  
The following cameras have support in the code, but have not been confirmed to actually work. If you have one of these cameras, and it does or does not work, please file an issue making a note of how it behaves, so that it can be added here.
  
  - ~Nikon D90~
  - Nikon D300, Nikon D300S, Nikon D500
  - Nikon D3200, Nikon D3300
  - Nikon D5000, Nikon D5300
  - Nikon D7000, Nikon D7200
  
  - Nikon Df
  - ~Nikon D3~, Nikon D3S, Nikon D3X, Nikon D4, Nikon D4S, Nikon D5, Nikon D6
  - Nikon D600, Nikon D610
  - Nikon D700, Nikon D780
  - Nikon D800E, Nikon D810, Nikon D810A, Nikon D850
    
Note: some cameras support larger LiveView image sizes, but it is not possible to select that at this time.
 
Many other cameras can in theory be made to work, but are not yet supported.

### Reported having Issues

- Nikon D3 with PTP Webcam v1.0.0-alpha6: camera does not enter LiveView mode when selecting video source.
- Nikon D90 with PTP Webcam v1.0.0-alpha6: camera does not enter LiveView mode when selecting video source.
 
### Not usable because of hardware limitations
 - Nikon D40, D60, D80, D200 do not support tethered live view.
 
## Known Issues
 
### Library Validation
 
macOS applications that have library validation enabled cannot load DAL plugins that have not been signed or signed by another developer. Therefore, some popular video conferencing tools do not work out of the box.
 
The easiest way to workaround is to remove the signature for the offending applications, but note that this might be affected by security settings on your system, and might require to relax security settings.

Status for an unknown app can be checked via `codesign -d --entitlements :- /Path/to/App` and if any entitlements show up, `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` needs to be among them: 
```
<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
<true/>
```
If it is not, codesigning has to be removed from the app and potentially its helper apps.

#### Zoom workaround
 
`codesign --remove-signature /Applications/zoom.us.app`
 
#### Skype workaround
 
Skype has several helper apps inside its application bundle that might need code signing disabled. 

```
codesign --remove-signature /Applications/Skype.app
cd /Applications/Skype.app/Contents/Frameworks
codesign --remove-signature Skype\ Helper.app
codesign --remove-signature Skype\ Helper\ \(Renderer\).app
```
Additional helpers might be named differently in different Skype versions.

#### Chrome workaround

```
codesign --remove-signature /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
codesign --remove-signature /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google\ Chrome\ Framework.framework/Helpers/Google\ Chrome\ Helper.app
codesign --remove-signature /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google\ Chrome\ Framework.framework/Helpers/Google\ Chrome\ Helper\ \(GPU\).app
codesign --remove-signature /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/Frameworks/Google\ Chrome\ Framework.framework/Helpers/Google\ Chrome\ Helper\ \(Plugin\).app
```
